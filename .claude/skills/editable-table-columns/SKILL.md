description: The md_comment_widget.py pattern for making a table field editable in this project's Flask UI — preview modal renders markdown, Edit opens an EasyMDE editor with image upload, save POSTs JSON and re-renders in place without reload. Use whenever the user asks to make a table field/column editable, or to add a markdown-editable cell to a template.

# Editable Table Columns

When the user asks to make a field in a table editable, always use the `md_comment_widget.py` pattern:

1. The cell contains a `<span class="*-preview" data-raw="...html-escaped markdown...">` that renders markdown on load.
2. Clicking the cell opens a **preview modal** (Bootstrap) showing the rendered markdown + an "Edit" button.
3. Clicking "Edit" closes the preview modal and opens an **EasyMDE editor modal** (with image upload toolbar + clipboard-paste-to-upload support).
4. Saving POSTs the markdown to the backend, then updates `span.dataset.raw` and re-renders the cell in place — no page reload.
5. The backend save route accepts JSON `{"description": "..."}` (or whichever field name) and returns `{"ok": true}`.

See `md_comment_widget.py` for the shared blueprint (`/upload-image`, `/uploads/<path>`) and reference the entity-description implementation in `templates/index.html` (search `viewEntityDesc`) as a concrete example.
