# Equity Research Earnings Update

Create professional **EARNINGS UPDATE REPORTS** analyzing quarterly results for companies already under coverage, following institutional standards (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley format).

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Length**: 8-12 pages
- **Word Count**: 3,000-5,000 words
- **Tables**: 1-3 summary tables (NOT comprehensive)
- **Figures**: 8-12 charts
- **Turnaround**: 1-2 days (within 24-48 hours of earnings)
- **Audience**: Clients already familiar with the company
- **Focus**: What's NEW - beat/miss, updated estimates, thesis impact
- **Font**: Times New Roman throughout (unless user specifies otherwise)

## When to Use

Use when the user requests:
- "Create an earnings update for [Company] Q3 2024"
- "Analyze [Company]'s quarterly results"
- "Post-earnings report for [Company]"
- "Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 update for [Company]"

**Do NOT use if:**
- User requests "initiation report" → Use different skill
- User requests "flash note" or "quick take" → Different format
- Company is not already covered → Need initiation first

## Guardrails (at-a-glance — the rules with the worst failure modes)

Compact index of the load-bearing don't-dos enforced throughout this skill.

- **Do not use earnings dates / numbers from training data.** Always search for the latest release and verify it's within 3 months of today. See Phase 1 "🚨 TRAINING DATA IS OUTDATED 🚨".
- **Do not write a beat/miss number without citing the consensus source by name + date.** "Beat consensus" is meaningless without "Bloomberg consensus as of YYYY-MM-DD" or "FactSet, accessed YYYY-MM-DD". See § "Citations & Source Attribution".
- **Do not invent 10-Q line items.** Every metric in the report traces to a specific page of the 10-Q, the earnings release, or the call transcript. If the company doesn't break out a metric (e.g. segment-by-region revenue), say so explicitly.
- **Do not write a guidance change ("raised", "cut", "color-bearing reaffirmation") without citing both the old guide and the new guide.** Both must be linked to their respective primary sources, not paraphrased.
- **Do not let a forward estimate update be ungrounded.** Every Old → New estimate line in the report must name the specific result that drove the change ("Q3 services margin came in 280 bp ahead; raised FY services margin estimate by 50 bp").
- **Do not omit URLs.** Every source in the Sources block is a clickable hyperlink (SEC EDGAR for filings, IR site for the earnings release/deck/transcript). Plain text references are a defect.
- **Do not skip the Data Used manifest** at the end of the report (Phase 4 output spec). The DOCX format already enforces the Sources block; the markdown handoff also gets a structured manifest so the data inventory is legible at a glance.
- **Do not run destructive SQL against `db/*.db`.** Read-only only. See [`CLAUDE.md`](../../../CLAUDE.md) § "Database Safety".

## Critical Requirements

### 1. Speed & Timeliness
- Publish within 24-48 hours of earnings release
- Focus on NEW information only
- Don't rehash company background extensively

### 2. Beat/Miss Analysis
- Lead with whether company beat or missed estimates
- Quantify variances (e.g., "Revenue beat by $120M or 3%")
- Explain WHY results differed from expectations

### 3. Summary Format
- Keep tables to 1-3 (summary only, not comprehensive)
- No full P&L/Cash Flow/Balance Sheet (just key metrics)
- Assume reader has seen initiation report

### 4. Citations & Source Attribution ⭐⭐⭐ MANDATORY

**CRITICAL**: Properly cite all data with SPECIFIC sources and CLICKABLE HYPERLINKS.

**Include specific citations WITH CLICKABLE LINKS in every figure and table:**

```
Source: Q3 2024 10-Q filed November 8, 2024; Company earnings release
        [Hyperlink "10-Q" to: https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/viewer?accession=...]
        [Hyperlink "earnings release" to: https://investor.company.com/news/q3-2024]
```

**HOW HYPERLINKS SHOULD APPEAR IN WORD:**
- Document names appear as blue, underlined clickable links
- Reader can Ctrl+Click to open source directly
- Not plain text URLs - formatted hyperlinks with display text

**REQUIRED SOURCES LIST:**

Cite in every earnings update:
- ✅ Earnings release (with date and URL)
- ✅ 10-Q filing (with filing date and EDGAR link)
- ✅ Earnings call transcript (with date)
- ✅ Investor presentation/supplemental materials (if available)
- ✅ Consensus estimates source (Bloomberg/FactSet/etc. with date)
- ✅ Prior guidance (from previous quarter's materials)

**REFERENCE SECTION WITH CLICKABLE HYPERLINKS:**

Include "Sources" section at end of report:

```
SOURCES & REFERENCES

Earnings Materials (Q3 2024):
• Earnings Release (November 7, 2024)
  [Hyperlink entire line to: https://investor.company.com/news/q3-2024-earnings]

• Form 10-Q (Filed November 8, 2024)
  [Hyperlink to: https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/viewer?accession=...]

• Earnings Call Transcript (November 7, 2024)
  [Hyperlink to: https://seekingalpha.com/article/...]

• Investor Presentation (November 7, 2024)
  [Hyperlink to: https://investor.company.com/presentations/q3-2024.pdf]
```

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] Every figure has source with specific document and date
- [ ] Every table has source with document reference
- [ ] Beat/miss analysis cites consensus source with date
- [ ] Guidance changes cite current and prior guidance sources
- [ ] Key statistics have footnotes
- [ ] Sources section lists all materials with URLs
- [ ] ALL URLs are CLICKABLE HYPERLINKS (not plain text)
- [ ] All SEC filings hyperlinked to EDGAR viewer

### 5. Updated Estimates
- Update forward estimates based on results
- Show old vs. new estimates clearly
- Explain what changed and why

## High-Level Workflow

The earnings update process follows 5 phases:

### Phase 1: Data Collection (30-60 minutes)

**🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL: TRAINING DATA IS OUTDATED 🚨🚨🚨**

**BEFORE STARTING - COMPLETE THESE 4 STEPS IN ORDER:**
1. **CHECK TODAY'S DATE** - Write down the current date
2. **SEARCH FOR LATEST** - Use web search: "[Company] latest earnings results"
3. **VERIFY THE DATE** - Confirm earnings release is within last 3 months
4. **CHECK TRANSCRIPT DATE** - Verify transcript date matches release date

**COMMON MISTAKE**: Using outdated earnings calls from training data instead of searching for the latest.

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ Search for latest earnings - do NOT rely on training data
- ✅ Write down today's date and the release date found
- ✅ Verify release date is within 3 months of today
- ✅ Verify transcript date matches release date
- ✅ If dates don't match or are old (>3 months), search again

**See [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md)** for detailed search procedures and verification steps.

### Phase 2: Analysis (2-3 hours)
- Beat/miss analysis for each key metric
- Segment/geographic/product breakdown
- Margin and guidance analysis
- Update financial model and estimates

**See [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md)** for detailed analysis framework.

### Phase 3: Chart Generation (1-2 hours)
Create 8-12 charts focusing on quarterly trends and what's new:
- Quarterly revenue progression
- Quarterly EPS progression
- Quarterly margin trends
- Revenue by segment/geography
- Key operating metrics
- Beat/miss summary
- Estimate revisions
- Valuation charts

**See [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md)** for chart specifications.

### Phase 4: Report Creation (2-3 hours)
Create 8-12 page DOCX report with specific structure.

**See [references/report-structure.md](references/report-structure.md)** for complete page-by-page templates and formatting requirements.

**High-level structure:**
- Page 1: Earnings summary with rating and price target
- Pages 2-3: Detailed results analysis
- Pages 4-5: Key metrics & guidance
- Pages 6-7: Updated investment thesis
- Pages 8-10: Valuation & estimates
- Pages 11-12: Appendix (optional)

### Phase 5: Quality Check & Delivery (30 minutes)
Verify content, formatting, accuracy, and timeliness before delivery.

**See [references/best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md)** for quality checklist and common mistakes to avoid.

### Data Used / 数据来源清单 (mandatory at the end of every report)

A structured manifest of evidence categories + dates + freshness. Goes at the end of the report (DOCX appendix or markdown footer), separate from but complementing the existing "SOURCES & REFERENCES" hyperlinked block. Format:

```markdown
## Data Used / 数据来源清单

**Quarterly results (the quarter under analysis)**
- Q<N> FY<YY> earnings release (released YYYY-MM-DD); 10-Q filed YYYY-MM-DD; earnings call transcript YYYY-MM-DD; earnings deck YYYY-MM-DD; investor presentation if separate.

**Prior-period anchors (for QoQ / YoY comparison)**
- Q<N-1> FY<YY> release YYYY-MM-DD; Q<N> FY<YY-1> release YYYY-MM-DD; latest 10-K (FY filed YYYY-MM-DD).

**Consensus + guidance**
- Bloomberg / FactSet consensus snapshot as of YYYY-MM-DD (one trading day before release). Prior FY guide from Q<N-1> release / call (issued YYYY-MM-DD); new FY guide from Q<N> release / call (issued YYYY-MM-DD).

**Market data**
- Closing price YYYY-MM-DD (before release); next-day reaction YYYY-MM-DD. TTM multiples as of YYYY-MM-DD. Source: Yahoo Finance / Bloomberg.

**Cross-coverage context**
- Latest [reports/company/<Slug>/<filename>.md](../../../reports/company/<Slug>/<filename>.md) (last updated YYYY-MM-DD) — read as structured input for thesis-impact section, not cited inline.

**Stale notices / coverage gaps**
- <bulleted list — sell-side estimate not available, transcript not yet published, segment break-out withheld, or "none">.
```

Place this block immediately above the SOURCES & REFERENCES section. The manifest summarizes categories + freshness; SOURCES & REFERENCES lists every URL cited inline.
